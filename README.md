**Customer Churn Prediction** (Machine Learning Project)

**Objective** :
The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the company) using machine learning models.

📊 **Dataset**

Customer data including:
- Gender
- Tenure
- Monthly charges
- Contract type
- Payment method
- Churn status

🛠 **Tools & Technologies**
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

**Steps Performed**
1. Data Cleaning
2. Handling missing values
3. Encoding categorical features
4. Feature selection
5. Model training:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
6. Model evaluation using:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion matrix
   - Classification report

**Results**

  | Logistic Regression : **78.8%** 
  | Random Forest       : 78.6% |
  | Decision Tree       : 71.4% |

Best model: **Logistic Regression**

 **Key Insight**
> By analyzing customer behavior, I found that features like **tenure and monthly charges** strongly influence churn.  
> This model can help the company identify at-risk customers early and design retention strategies, which can help reduce revenue loss.
